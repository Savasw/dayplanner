# Test the Web Apps 

The application is based on managing the Day-To-Day Engagements. User can add their engagements randomly with following parameters,

Parameter | Description
------------ | -------------
ame | Title of engagement
Location | Location of the Engagement
Meeting Date | Date of engagement 
Start Time | Start time of engagement
End Time | End time of engagement

All the Engagement are stored in __AzureDB for PostgreSQL__. It is a powerful, open source object-relational database system which has `GeoSpatial` capabilities `PostGIS` functionality 
and it is managed service by Azure by the `Azure Database for PostgreSQL Service` name. The data are plotted on the map according to Engagement Date and Ascending order of the Start Time. 

__Azure Search Service__ is a component and one of the best service of the Microsoft Azure Cloud Platform providing indexing and querying capabilities for data uploaded to Microsoft servers. 
The Search as a service framework is intended to provide developers with complex search capabilities for mobile and web development while hiding infrastructure requirements and search algorithm complexities. 
Azure Search is a recent addition to Microsoft's Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) approach.

__Azure App Service__ is integrate App Service into your existing frameworks, languages and tooling to accelerate your development. It is rapidly build, deploy and manage powerful web, mobile and API apps for employees or customers using a single back-end. 
Build standards-based web apps and APIs using .NET, Java, Node.js, PHP and Python.
